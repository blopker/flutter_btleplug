# Flutter BtlePlug

A cross-platform Flutter Bluetooth plugin, based on [btleplug](https://github.com/deviceplug/btleplug).

**This is a work in progress, do not use in production (yet)**

## Setup
The project uses [Melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/) to build the package.
`dart pub global activate melos`

## Getting Started
To build locally for e.g. Android run:
`melos run build:android`

Then copy platform-build/android.tar.gz to packages/flutter_btleplug/android/$VERSION.tar.gz

### Contributors
The package is in early development, if you want to help open an issue and we'll figure it out.
